# The Tarot of the False Dichotomy

My personal tarot deck, designed from scratch, freely available for anyone to use under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license.  It is a standard 78 cards, with 22 Major Arcana and 56 Minor Arcana across 4 suits.  However, the similarities with a traditional Rider-Waite deck end there.  Three key design principles are prominent throughout:

1) There is not a linear journey through each suit or through the Major Arcana.  For example, each Minor Arcana has its own preposition rather than a numbered rank.

2) There is not an “upright” or “reversed” state for the cards in a traditional sense, because that applies a moral judgement to things that aren’t inherently good or bad.  I like to use face-down cards to represent the energy of the card being in some way “off.”

3) There is not a true dichotomy on the cards, meaning that “opposites” presented on each card have as much in common as in contrast.

Please review the guidebook in this repo for more details.

# Printing this deck

I personally use https://www.makeplayingcards.com/ to print the deck, but the images (or at least the source files from this repo) should be usable with any roughly 5:9 ratio card.  The exact intended dimensions are as follows:

* Print Safe Area - 2.51" x 4.51" (753 x 1353 @ 300dpi)
* Cut Area - 2.75" x 4.75" (825 x 1425 @ 300dpi)
* Extra Bleed Area - 2.99" x 4.99" (897 x 1497 @ 300dpi)
