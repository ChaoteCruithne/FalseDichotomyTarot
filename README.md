# Printing this deck

I personally use https://www.makeplayingcards.com/ to print the deck, but the images (or at least the source files from this repo) should be usable with any roughly 5:9 ratio card.  The exact intended dimensions are as follows:

* Print Safe Area - 2.51" x 4.51" (753 x 1353 @ 300dpi)
* Cut Area - 2.75" x 4.75" (825 x 1425 @ 300dpi)
* Extra Bleed Area - 2.99" x 4.99" (897 x 1497 @ 300dpi)
